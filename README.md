# [Title of App WIP]
This is a simple text editor built in C, utilizing GTK4 and Libadwaita packages.

# Demo of App

# Language Server (IDE)

If using `neovim` or `vscode`, clangd will need the file `compile_commands.json` to find gtk4 libraries.
To generate the file install [`bear`](https://github.com/rizsotto/bear) from your distro's package manager and run `bear -- make`.
